I did a 2D platform video game, using some aseets by Platzi, that they shared in the course that I follow. It have 2 levels, the main character have some enemys and coins to collect, so I had to develop the behaviour of every element in the game, also the portal animation, I use a particle system and other things to let pass the main character to the next level.


## Installation

I use [ ```Unity Hub```](https://unity.com/es/download), choose the first option and download it, then you just have to installed and add the folder there.

Then just open and enjoy it.

Version - ```2019.3.0a4```

Language - ```C#```
